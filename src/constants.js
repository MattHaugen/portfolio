The <i>Osprey</i> and her crew have scraped out their own small place in it all, scavenging useful materials from the surface while dodging the authoritarian Royal navy and avoiding dismemberment by the vicious mutant creatures now roaming the Earth. When the crew encounters a survivor who claims she can disperse the poisonous clouds and bring sunlight back to the planet, they embark on an epic journey to save the world.</p>"
